Oct W2 discussion:
1. Two plots:  
i) statistical plot: average against average (regression, time aggregation)  
ii) science plot: trace the trajectory of real agent (under retrograde-allowing system, super-linear is not unsustainable)  
finding empirical case would be interesting e.g. agency gradually demising over > 3 moths  
get slope on log-log scale x: number of employee y: supervisor number,  

2. research hypothesis: Prey-predator dynamic of bureaucracy and its win-win strategy via preventive mainted
- fractal structure (judge-lawyer, lawyer-companies, `sup`-`sub` are similary structured)  
- Q2. how to model preventive maintenence role of `sup`  (model uploaded)
- Q3. how to formulate additional result of interaction of sup and sub (developing other factors than detected mistake that affects birth and death of each stocks)
- Q4. could capability traps (worse than better dynamics (zero-sum) be incoporated with preventive maintenceyen fig2.11)

## List of possible problems (what do system fear?)
- unfair


## List of possible improvements (what do system desire?)
- lower use of budget (always?)


## List of administer's work to prevent system's fear

## List of administer's work to go towards system's desire
regulation to prevent possible problem (i.e. Administer's job)
- ensure reported represent reality, post-stratification (or its [multi-level version]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_regression_with_poststratification)))
