# Designing Regulation based on Empirical Temporal and Cross-sectional Characterization

bureaucracy change over time, and whether we can model bureaucracy as preventative maintenance. 


Fedscope Data Analysis Task

Data to use: 
To start the analysis, we first start by looking at FedScope data, which contains detailed individual-level information on US federal government employees:  https://www.opm.gov/data/index.aspx

Detailed instructions for Anjie:
Data structure: 
The data file is called "Employment Cube" on the FedScope site. Each time point is stored as a separate file, so we'll need to write a script to process one year of data, and then repeat it on several years of data. Note that data tables are given on the sub-agency level, which needs to be aggregated to the agency level. 

Step 1: 
Download one set of Employment Cube data (at one point in time). Read data documentation and skim through the variable list. 

For each federal agency, extract: (1) number of total employees in the agency, (2) number of supervisors/managers in the agency, (3) the frequency of all occupations, (4) any other variables Angie thinks could matter for bureaucracy. 

Vicky has worked on one year of data (Sept 2018 Employment cuve) before, so Vicky will provide previous code as a reference. 

Step 2: 

Data Sources and Details: 
hypothesis
supervisor/non-supervisor increasease (2018/09 vs 2021/09) 


## Motivating research questions/objectives
How does the number of people serving regulation/maintenance roles (e.g., managers, supervisors, secretaries, janitors, etc., or other metrics Angie comes up with) in each organization change over time? 
Are there commonalities across organizations? How does this rate of change depend on attributes of the organization, such as size, the number of different functions it tries to coordinate, the amount of things itâ€™s trying to do? Or other attributes not listed here? Can we model bureaucracy as preventative maintenance?

# Optimal level of Bureaucracy  

## List of possible problems (what do system fear?)
- unfair


## List of possible improvements (what do system desire?)
- lower use of budget (always?)


## List of administer's work to prevent system's fear

## List of administer's work to go towards system's desire
regulation to prevent possible problem (i.e. Administer's job)
- ensure reported represent reality, post-stratification (or its [multi-level version]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_regression_with_poststratification)))
